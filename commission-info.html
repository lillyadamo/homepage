            <p class="s1title">commission information</p>
            <p class="s1para">I'm so glad you're here! I promise that I will deliver you the best piece
                I can create, and I will not settle for anything less!
                <br>
                The mediums I work in are: Charcoal, Oil and Acryilc, and digital!
            </p>
            <p class="s1para">Pricing commissions is a complex endeavour. I'll explain how I price my pieces
                so you can have a better idea on what you can expect to pay!</p>

            <p class="s1para">For more simplistic pieces, I use the equation: <strong>time + materials = commission price.</strong>
                <br> Prices will increase/decrease depending on what medium the piece is completed in.
                <br> An example of a less complex piece would be: a portrait from the chest up with a plain background.
                <br> I would also price most digital art under this category.
            </p>
            <p class="s1para">For more complex piece, I use the equation: <strong> $n × (Years’ Experience) × (Difficulty Multiplier) + Materials = Commission Price </strong> 
                (where n= the number of years I've been taking commissions)
        
            <br> I prefer to use this for more complex pieces as it would most likely take me a while to complete 
            and therefor would not want to charge an hourly rate. 
            <br>An example of a more complex piece would be: an oil painting on a canvas with single or multiple individuals
            and multiple complex elements. 
            </p>
            <p class="s1para">If this sounds good to you and you're interested in commissioning some art from me,
            please <a href="mailto:lillyadamo@outlook.com">email me</a> and we can 
            discuss further!
            <br> If you aren't schedulling a meeting and are okay with doing everything over email, please have some
            reference photos ready for me (if they're needed!)</p>
