        <p>Welcome to my website. My name is Lilly Adamo. I am currently enrolled
            in the Application Development and Delivery program at Red River Polytechnic.
            I have always had an interest and passion for computers from a young age, almost
            immediately becoming the designated tech support for my family. I would usually work
            on call, getting my Mom to drive me to my grandma's house whenever there was something 
            <em>urgently wrong</em> with her computer, like the volume not working. She was always so 
            impressed with my skills! Then as payment I would accept nothing less than a cup of espresso
            with milk and a biscotti.<br>
            Much of my childhood was spent modding my gaming systems so I could get new Mario Kart Wii tracks,
            or different games for my DS and 3DS. When I wasn't console gaming, I was playing on a Minecraft
            Server I had created and port-forwarded myself to play with my friends. (It was the latest and greatest,
            I had been the first of my friends to make a server anyone could join without the use of 3rd party programs!)<br>
            I will also never forget that in the 6th grade I was able to do a project on whatever I wanted,
            and I decided to do mine on computer viruses.<br>
            Despite all of this, I decided that Psychiatric Nursing was the career path I wanted to pursue. As 
            you can imagine, that didn't last long.<br>
            After much contemplation, a few tough decisions, and an even tougher conversation with my parents,
            I decided that computer science was ultimately the path I wanted to take. Though, I know my credentials
            as "Family Tech-Support" were not going to cut it.<br>
            I decided to return to school and I could not be happier with the decision I made. I am currently in term 
            two of five at Red River and I have already learned so much and am so excited to continue my learning journey.
            <br>
            Aside from all the tech stuff, I am a hobbyist photographer, and I also enjoy drawing and sketching. I own 
            quite a few cameras, both film and digital. My two favourites that I own are my Ricoh GR IIIx. I take it
            everywhere with me and its perfect for taking candid photos. My favourite film camera I own is my Olympus XA.
            I appreciate how small and compact it is, and it has a really unique design as well. <br>
            As for drawing, some of my more professional work is completed with charcoal on paper, which is my 
            favourite medium to work with. I do carry a sketchbook around with me and tend to doodle when I'm bored.
            And I also enjoy using Procreate on my iPad. I've had many welcome opportunities to complete commissions
            for people, both in my personal life as well as individuals who have seen my work online. I am grateful
            for every interaction I've had and nothing makes me happier to deliver a piece to someone who is 
            thoroughly happy with the final product.<br>
            My hobbies are all things that I consider to be lifelong journeys for me and I hope to constantly improve 
            my skills so I can keep creating work that forever increases in quality!
