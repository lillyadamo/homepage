# First Entry - Pomodoro Timer
_Date: May 12, 2025_

I'm going to be keeping track of development through these devlogs.

I want to see how my programming skills progress over time and I'd like to have an archive of how I completed a task or fixed a bug.

Here are some concept arts of the app. I picked the specific color scheme as I plan to have some sort of 
gardening/harvesting aspect to it later on, so I picked more "farm-like" colours.
