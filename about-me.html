            <p class="s1title">about me</p>
            <p class="s1para">I have been drawing and painting for as long as I can remember. 
                Unfortunately I didn't have as much time for my hobby when I started university in 2017, but I have
                since found the time to persue my passion again and I am focusing hard on trying to improve my skills.</p>
               
               <p class="s1para"> Aside from art, much of my free time is spent teaching myself how to code. As with art, I have been passionate 
                about computers from a young age and I was the designated tech support for my family. I would usually work on call,
                rushing to my grandmas house whenever something was wrong with her computer, like the volume not working. She was always so impressed
                with my skills!</p>
                
                <p class="s1para">Jokes aside, much of my childhood was spent modding my gaming systems so I could get new Mario Kart Wii tracks, or free games for my DS and 3DS. 
                When I wasn't console gaming,
                I was playing Minecraft on a server I had created myself to play with my friends. 
                Despite my thorough interest and knowlege of computers and computer networking, 
                I decided that Psychiatric Nursing the carreer path I wanted to persue when I applied for 
                university. As you can imagine, that didn't last long. </p>
                
                <p class="s1para">After much contemplation and a few tough decisions, 
                I decided that computer science was ultimately the path I wanted to take. 
                While I am looking to enroll in Red River's Intro to Computer Systems sometime in the near future,
                I'm teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript through The Odin Project while I wait. 
                The course helped me update my website to what you see before you currently. 
                I'm really looking forward to expanding my knowlege! </p> 
                
                <p class="s1para">Some of my other interest include: Art history, photography, photoshop and video editing, and crocheting.
                    Right now most of my time is dedicated to improving my skills that will hopefully be useful in my carrer someday! </p>
